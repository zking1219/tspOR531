# tspOR531

## Usage

Simply run
`python3 TSP.py`
and you'll notice that two csv files are created - one for Part A. where we start and end in Brussels, and another for Part B. where we begin in Brussels and can end anywhere.

`TSP.py` is an implementation of the simulated annealing optimization algorithm. The functions aren't well commented but I think they're fairly self explanatory. Simulated annealing is probabilistic algorithm, not unlike the evolutionary solver we attempted to use in class; the csvs I've uploaded for Part A. and Part B. are a couple of the better results. My solution can be optimized by tuning the initial temperature, max iterations, and alpha parameters more rigorously.
